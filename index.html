			<h1>NAV REVAMP</h1>
			<p>Working on the new site navigation was the most rewarding experience I had in 2013. Collaborating with Will, Maggie, and Kyle was an excellent opportunity to bounce ideas off of each other and make sure we ended up with the best possible solution. The timeframe was tight and forced us to make decisions efficently and effectively. I learned a lot with this project and hope to work on more of the same.</p>

			<h1>918 POSTERS</h1>
			<p>Working on various 918 event posters served as a nice distraction and reminded me about where I came from as a graphic designer. The designs were completely up in the air and having complete control over went our allowed me to really take advantage of such a liberating project. I had a lot of fun with these.</p>

			<h1>UX SITE</h1>
			<p>The UX Team needed a place to claim on the internet. That and we needed a tool to show potential hires how fun we are and how hard we work. The research and collaboration that went into this, whether it was chatting with the team on what they’d like to have included, or working with Jared to get the code right, I learned a lot and think it came out pretty well.</p><a href="http://ux.livingsocial.com/">VISIT SITE &rarr;</a><br><br><br>

			<h1>BACKYARD FESTIVAL</h1>
			<p>Getting to brand, create a website, and all other promotional material of a music festival is any designer’s dream job. This was a great learning experience on how to manage my time and the client’s expectations, and my first real shot at a total web page design. Although this may have been my most dramatic Pooptouch&trade;, I still learned a whole lot and am still proud of what was produced.</p>

			<p>Circular proved to be a massive undertaking that is still being worked on today. In a very short time with a very small team, we built a brand new product from the ground up as an SEO play working with some of the top brands in the world. Every aspect is a challenge and is resulting in a profitable business.</p><a href="https://www.livingsocial.com/coupons/">VISIT SITE &rarr;</a><br><br><br>

			<h1>GIFTING</h1>
			<p>Gifting was a huge challenge. The goal was to make it easier for users to understand and be able to breeze through the checkout gifting options. Another challenge was making the gifting a more personal experience as the recipient is not getting a physical product most of the time, so it needed to emulate “gift opening”. I think that we achieved that with these designs.</p>

			<h1>LEARNINGS &amp; THOUGHTS</h1>
			<p>2013 was a big year for me. It challenged me to take on a new role. To give up that role and take on another completely different. I realized that chasing money is less important than furthering my career and working with truly unique and incredibly talented individuals. I was hit with the realization that in order to be a good designer, I needed to continually push myself outside of my comfort zone and ask for help. I learned that code isn’t that scary, heck, I made this, as well as a bunch of <a class="my-link" href="http://kalinwood.com/">other sites!</a> All-in-all, 2013 was a delight and I hope that 2014 will continue down that path.</p>
